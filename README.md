The frontend project is already integrated on the server.
The project has one template, which consists of two graphs that asynchronously request data from the server via the API.

In order to run the project on your local machine (and see your CPU usage), you need to clone the repo and install the requirements for the backend. 
After activating the environment, you should be in the "server" directory to start the server with the following command:

> python main.py
